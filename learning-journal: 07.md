# My Reflection

## Today 7/19/2022 I learned about Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables and how to add them to html. Also learned about constructors only need to create one object, but if you have to create more than one. We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a height property - then we have to remember to update every object.
