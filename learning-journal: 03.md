Today we learned CSS block and inline block. Learned how to move them, size and how they miss each other up. Learn box size. I learned how to do array and learned how to do loops.

I am ok with the CSS little struggling with loops. Still behind with lab 2 and terminal issues but got that fix terminal. Just need to take it one step at a time.
