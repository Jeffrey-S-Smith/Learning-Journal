Today we learned bacic HTML, CSS, JavaScript. We learned Data types,Primitives. We where taught with example for each thing we learned.

Today I felt behind on things cause of some of my issues with pre setup of brew in the terminal. I was not installed. It weigh on my mind. So that slowed me down on taking notes and I missed alot of setting up my lab in the terminal which typing that was slow for me to keep up.
