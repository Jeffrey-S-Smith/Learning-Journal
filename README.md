# Learning-Journal

## Reflection
Write a brief reflection on your learning today, or use the prompt below to get started.

Consider the following quote from the article linked above:

“[Adult learners] are deeply involved not only in planning, but also in evaluating their learning, as they know what knowledge they want to acquire.”

In other words, you should continuously evaluate your learning, and your learning journal is an excellent way to keep track of that. How do you see yourself planning and evaluating your learning? What details will you record and/or measure? How often will you evaluate what you want to learn?

Capture your thoughts in the text field below; you will have an assignment like this each class day going forward. Note that your instructor and TAs will have access to your journal here in this assignment, but that this content is not publicly visible.
